# Spackel

Spackel is a stack-based programming language implemented in Rust.

## Usage

To interpret a Spackel program, run Spackel with the `run` command and provide
the name of the file:

```sh
cargo run run program.spkl
```

To compile a Spackel program to an executable, provide the `compile` command
instead of `run`. This produces an object file which will then have to be linked
with the prelude (and libc):

```sh
cargo run compile program.spkl
cc -o main prelude.o main.o
./main
```

The prelude can be compiled by running `make`.

The script `./compile` is provided for convenience and performs these steps for
you, including ensuring that the prelude and the compiler itself are up to date:

```sh
./compile program.spkl
./main
```

## Syntax

- Source files must be encoded as UTF-8.
- Instructions are separated by whitespace.
- Comments start with `#`.

## Data types

- `i32`: the signed 32-bit integer type.
- `bool`: boolean `true` or `false`.
  **NOTE: booleans are not fully implemented yet.**

## Macros

A macro is a sequence of tokens that has been given a name. When the name
appears later in the program, it gets replaced with said tokens.

```spackel
macro add-five
  5 +
end

4 add-five println
```

The program above will expand to `4 5 + println`, printing 9.

Macros cannot be nested, but you can use a previously defined macro in the
definition of a new macro.

## Control flow

- `then BODY end`: pops a boolean and runs `BODY` if it is true.

## Instructions

### Constants

- Integers: at least one decimal digit, optionally preceded by a `+` or `-`.
- Booleans: `true` or `false`.
- `ÃŸ`: pushes the number 1945.

### Math

- Binary operators (these take two numbers as arguments and produce one number):
  - `+`: addition.
  - `-`: subtraction.
  - `*`: multiplication.
  - `/`: division.
  - `%`: remainder after division. This is *not* the same as modulo when
    negative numbers are involved.
  - `+ðŸ¤¡`: silly addition. This is like regular addition with some exceptions:
    - $9+10 = 21$
    - $10+9 = 21$
    - $1+1 = 1$

### Comparisons

- `<`: less than.
- `<=`: less than or equal.
- `=`: equal.
- `>=`: greater than or equal.
- `>`: greater than.

### Boolean logic

- `not`
- `and`
- `or`
- `xor`
- `nand`: equivalent to `and not`.
- `nor`: equivalent to `or not`.
- `xnor`: equivalent to `xor not`.

### Stack manipulation

- `drop`: pops one element.
- `dup`: duplicates the top element.
- `swap`: swaps the top two elements.
- `over`: duplicates the second element onto the top of the stack, turning `a b`
  into `a b a`.
- `nip`: pops the second element.
- `tuck`: duplicates and tucks away the top element, turning `a b` into `b a b`.

### IO

- `print`: pops and prints the top element. Note that this does not flush the
  output stream.
- `println`: pops and prints the top element, followed by a new line.
- `print-char`: pops the top element, reinterprets it as unsigned, converts that
  to a Unicode scalar value, or `U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER` in the case of an
  invalid code point, and prints it.
