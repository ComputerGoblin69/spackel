# Spackel

Spackel is a stack-based programming language implemented in Rust.

## Usage

To interpret a Spackel program, run Spackel with the `run` command and provide
the name of the file:

```sh
cargo run run program.spkl
```

To compile a Spackel program to an executable, provide the `compile` command
instead of `run`. This produces an object file which will then have to be linked
with the runtime (and libc):

```sh
cargo run compile program.spkl
cc -o main runtime.o main.o
./main
```

The runtime can be compiled by running `make`.

The script `./compile` is provided for convenience and performs these steps for
you, including ensuring that the runtime and the compiler itself are up to date:

```sh
./compile program.spkl
./main
```

## Syntax

- Source files must be encoded as UTF-8.
- Instructions are separated by whitespace.
- Comments start with `#`.

## Data types

- `i32`: the signed 32-bit integer type.
- `bool`: boolean `true` or `false`.
- `type`: the type of types. If you run into Girard's paradox because of this,
  please file an issue.

Types are values but you can't do much with them yet, other than shuffle them
around with the stack manipulation instructions.

## Macros

A macro is a sequence of tokens that has been given a name. When the name
appears later in the program, it gets replaced with said tokens.

```spackel
macro add-five
  5 +
end

4 add-five println
```

The program above will expand to `4 5 + println`, printing 9.

Macros cannot be nested, but you can use a previously defined macro in the
definition of a new macro.

## Control flow

- `then BODY end`: pops a boolean and runs `BODY` if it is true.
- `then THEN else ELSE end`: pops a boolean and runs `THEN` if it is true or
  `ELSE` if it is false.

## User-defined functions

Functions are defined as follows, where `input-N` are the types of the
parameters and `output-N` are the types of the returned values:

```spackel
fn function-name : input-1 input-2 -> output-1 output-2 do
  # ...
end
```

## Instructions

### Constants

- Integers: at least one decimal digit, optionally preceded by a `+` or `-`.
- Booleans: `true` or `false`.
- `ÃŸ`: pushes the number 1945.

### Math

- Binary operators (these take two numbers as arguments and produce one number):
  - `+`: addition.
  - `-`: subtraction.
  - `*`: multiplication.
  - `/`: division.
  - `%`: remainder after division. This is *not* the same as modulo when
    negative numbers are involved.
  - `+ðŸ¤¡`: silly addition. This is like regular addition with some exceptions:
    - $9+10 = 21$
    - $10+9 = 21$
    - $1+1 = 1$

### Comparisons

- `<`: less than.
- `<=`: less than or equal.
- `=`: equal.
- `>=`: greater than or equal.
- `>`: greater than.

### Boolean logic

- `not`
- `and`
- `or`
- `xor`
- `nand`: equivalent to `and not`.
- `nor`: equivalent to `or not`.
- `xnor`: equivalent to `xor not`.

### Stack manipulation

- `drop`: pops one element.
- `dup`: duplicates the top element.
- `swap`: swaps the top two elements.
- `over`: duplicates the second element onto the top of the stack, turning `a b`
  into `a b a`.
- `nip`: pops the second element.
- `tuck`: duplicates and tucks away the top element, turning `a b` into `b a b`.

### IO

- `print`: pops and prints the top element. Note that this does not flush the
  output stream.
- `println`: pops and prints the top element, followed by a new line.
- `print-char`: pops the top element, reinterprets it as unsigned, converts that
  to a Unicode scalar value, or `U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER` in the case of an
  invalid code point, and prints it.

### Type shenanigans

- `type-of`: replaces the top element with its type.
